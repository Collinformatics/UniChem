To download the dataset, follow the link at:
https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/UniChem/data/table_dumps/

The full file is ~34 GB, so is very time consuming to work with. 

For testing the scripts use saveSubset.py to inspect the downloaded .tsv file, and to saving a smaller set of stuctures.
